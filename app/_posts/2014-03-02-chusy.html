	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>CHUSY is a framework modeled after <a href="http://susy.oddbird.net/">SUSY</a>, its goal is to be like SUSY, but not opaque and confusing. It makes prototyping and maintenance of multi-breakpoint liquid grids fast, easy, and fun!</p>
	<p>CHUSY has 2 options: "orginal" and "flexible gutter". Both are very much alike. They are easy to define breakpoint and fully fluid. The differences is how the column and gutter works. Following are the Pros and Cons of both options</p>

	<h3>Chusy original</h3>
	<p>How it works: `Orginal` takes `base width`, `column width`, `gutter-width` and `column inner padding` to calculate  precise percentage for each element.
	<ul>
		<li>Pro: User can define `Column padding` and `Gutter width` with specific number, which will be converted to percentage automatically. It gives user more options to control the look of the grid.</li>
		<li>Cons: Column padding and gutter are fluid. It can't create fixed padding and gutter. It requires some level of calculation to set up the grid.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you have any question about `Chusy Original` please contact Choshun Snyder email:csnyder@hugeinc.com</p>

	<h3>Chusy flexible gutter</h3>
	<p>How it works: `Flexible gutter` gets the column width by taking 100% dividee by the total # columns. It uses `column inner padding` to create a gutter.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Pro: User can define gutter with a fixed number or percentage to create fixed or fluid gutter look. No calculation for setting up the grid, simply enter the total column.</li>
		<li>Cons: Since the column uses `column inner padding` to fake the gutter, you may need extra markup if more padding is needed between the content and its parent column</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Installation</h2>

	<h3>Original</h3>
	<p>Copy and paste _base.scss and _mixins.scss into a working compass project (http://compass-style.org/install/)</p>
	<p>Reference _base and _mixins in needed scss files with:</p>

{% highlight css %}
	@import "base";
	@import "mixins";
{% endhighlight %}

	<p>Done!</p>


	<h3>Flexible gutter</h3>
	<p>Copy and paste _base.scss and _mixins-flexible-gutter.scss into a working compass project (http://compass-style.org/install/)</p>
	<p>Reference _base and _mixins-flexible-gutter in needed scss files with:</p>

{% highlight css %}
	@import "base";
	@import "mixins-flexible-gutter";
{% endhighlight %}

	<p>Done!</p>

<section data-nav="Options" id="options">
	<h2>Options</h2>

	<h3>Making breakpoints</h3>

	<p>In _base.scss there are breakpoint variables that are defined by browser viewport widths.</p>
	<p>For example:</p>

	{% highlight sass %}$small-screen: small-screen 0 599px;{% endhighlight %}

	<p>$small-screen is a breakpoint variable that defines the threshold width of 0 to 599px.</p>
	<p>This is the ONLY place you'll need to define breakpoints for the whole project.</p>
	<p>You did it! good job</p>


	<h3>Making grids</h3>

	<p>At the top of _mixins is the mixin at-breakpoint($viewport).</p>
	<p>For each breakpoint there is an associated grid configuration. This creates the liquid grid that has unique column, gutter, and grid padding in percent.</p>
	<p>In the case of using our previous breakpoint "$small-screen" we define the grid:</p>

{% highlight sass %}
// if the first value of the variable $small-screen (it's value being: "small-screen 0 599px") is small screen...
@if nth($viewport, 1) == small-screen {
	// at base ideal width of 400...
	$base-width: 400px;

	// the columns will be this ideal px width (which in turn produce the number of liquid columns)
	$column-width: 43.3333333333333px;

 	// with the gutters of the columns being 20px
 	$gutter-width: 20px;

	// the grid padding of the whole grid on the left and right will be 20px
	$grid-padding: 20px;

	// don't worry about me
	$active-width: $base-width - (2 * $grid-padding);

	// another thing that is derived from previous values
	$inner-padding: 100 / ($active-width / $grid-padding) * 1%;
}
{% endhighlight %}

	<p>This creates a 6 column liquid grid for the breakpoint $small-screen.</p>
	<p>This is the ONLY place you define grids.</p>
	<p>NOTE: It is important that you calculate the values as precise as possible (ie 43px WILL look way different than 43.33333333333333333333px). Don't trust the designs, plug in the cols/gutters/grid padding and make sure it equals the defined ideal width.</p>
	<p>Huzzah!</p>

	<h3>Using the Responsive Grid</h3>

	<h4>Original</h4>
	<p>We have breakpoints from _base, and unique liquid grids for each breakpoint defined in at-breakpoint() in _mixins, how do we use these in our scss files?</p>
	<p>With the mixin span-columns() inside the at-breakpoint() mixin of course!</p>
	<h5>Example 1</h5>

{% highlight sass %}
#wrapper {
	@include at-breakpoint($small-screen) {
		#header {
			@include span-columns(3);
		}
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

	<p>At viewport $small-screen (0-599px defined in _base), the #header will span 3 columns, in this case 3 columns will be ~50%, cause the grid ends up being a 6 col grid (see step 3)</p>
	<h5>Example</h5>
{% highlight sass %}
#wrapper {
	@include at-breakpoint($large-screen) {
		#header {
			@include span-columns(3);
		}
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

	<p>At viewport $large-screen (1000px up as defined in _base) the same exact #header div will be at ~25%, 'cause that grid ends up being 12 columns as defined in _mixins.</p>
	<p>That's it!</p>
	<p>The rest of the mixins are just commented frosting on the delicious sponge cake that is CHUSY.</p>

	<h4>Flexible Gutter</h4>
	<p>In the flexible gutter version of chusy, `column width` is 100% divided by the total columns. The gutter is created by the padding on the columns. You can specify gutter width in _base.scss `$gutter-width`.  You can define total number of columns in the break point mixin:

{% highlight sass %}
//in _base.scss
$gutter-width: 30px; // it creates 15px padding left and right on a column

// in _mixins-flexible-gutter.scss
// if the first value of the variable $small-screen (it's value being: "small-screen 0 599px") is small screen...
@if nth($viewport, 1) == small-screen {

 	// defines total columns
 	$total-columns: 6;

 	// calculate each column's width
	$column-width: (100 /$total-columns) * 1%;

	// defines the margin between content and the browser border.
	$page-margin: 3%;

}
{% endhighlight %}

	<p>Define the column width with span-columns();
	<h5>Example</h5>

{% highlight sass %}
.side-content {
	// .side-content will take up 3 columns as its width: 3 * 100% / 12 = 25%
	@include span-columns(3);

	// .side-content will take up 6 columns as its width: 6 * 100% / 6 = 100%
	@include at-breakpoint($small-screen) {
		@include span-columns(6);
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}
