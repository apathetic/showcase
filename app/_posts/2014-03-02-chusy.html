	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>CHUSY is a framework modeled after <a href="http://susy.oddbird.net/">SUSY</a>, its goal is to be like SUSY, but not opaque and confusing. It makes prototyping and maintenance of multi-breakpoint liquid grids fast, easy, and fun!</p>
	<p>There are two flavors: "Original" and "Flexible Gutter", which are very much alike. While both are fully fluid, there are differences is how the columns and gutters work. Here is a brief overview:

	<h3>Original</h3>
	<p>How it works: <strong>Orginal</strong> takes <i>base width</i>, <i>column width</i>, <i>gutter-width</i> and <i>column inner padding</i> to calculate precise percentages for each element.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Pro</strong>: User can define <i>Column padding</i> and <i>gutter width</i> with a specific number, which will be converted to a percentage automatically. It gives user more options to control the look of the grid.</li>
		<li><strong>Cons</strong>: Column padding and gutter are fluid. It can't create fixed padding and gutter. It requires some level of calculation to set up the grid.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you have any question about the <strong>Original</strong>, please contact <a href="mailto:csnyder@hugeinc.com">Choshun Snyder</a></p>

	<h3>Flexible Gutter</h3>
	<p>How it works: <strong>Flexible gutter</strong> gets the column width by taking 100% divided by the total # columns. It uses <i>column inner padding</i> to create a gutter.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Pro</strong>: User can define gutters with a fixed number or percentage to create fixed or fluid gutter look. No calculation for setting up the grid, simply enter the total column.</li>
		<li><strong>Cons</strong>: Since the column uses <i>column inner padding</i> to fake the gutter, you may need extra markup if more padding is needed between the content and its parent column</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you have any question about the <strong>Flexible Gutter</strong> variant, please contact <a href="mailto:mli@hugeinc.com">Miranda Li</a> </p>

	<h2>Installation</h2>

	<h3>Original</h3>
	<p>Copy and paste _base.scss and _mixins.scss into a working compass project (http://compass-style.org/install/)</p>
	<p>Reference _base and _mixins in needed scss files with:</p>

{% highlight css %}
@import "base";
@import "mixins";
{% endhighlight %}

	<p>Done!</p>


	<h3>Flexible gutter</h3>
	<p>Copy and paste _base.scss and _mixins-flexible-gutter.scss into a working compass project (http://compass-style.org/install/)</p>
	<p>Reference _base and _mixins-flexible-gutter in needed scss files with:</p>

{% highlight css %}
@import "base";
@import "mixins-flexible-gutter";
{% endhighlight %}

	<p>Done!</p>

<section data-nav="Options" id="options">
	<h2>Options</h2>

	<h3>Making breakpoints</h3>

	<p>In _base.scss there are breakpoint variables that are defined by browser viewport widths.</p>
	<p>For example:</p>

	{% highlight sass %}$small-screen: small-screen 0 599px;{% endhighlight %}

	<p><code>$small-screen</code> is a breakpoint variable that defines the threshold width of 0 to 599px.</p>
	<p>This is the ONLY place you'll need to define breakpoints for the whole project.</p>
	<p>You did it! good job</p>


	<h3>Making grids</h3>

	<p>At the top of _mixins is the mixin <code>at-breakpoint($viewport)</code>.</p>
	<p>For each breakpoint there is an associated grid configuration. This creates the liquid grid that has unique column, gutter, and grid padding in percent.</p>
	<p>In the case of using our previous breakpoint <code>$small-screen</code> we define the grid:</p>

{% highlight sass %}
// if the first value of the variable $small-screen (it's value being: "small-screen 0 599px") is small screen...
@if nth($viewport, 1) == small-screen {
	// at base ideal width of 400...
	$base-width: 400px;

	// the columns will be this ideal px width (which in turn produce the number of liquid columns)
	$column-width: 43.3333333333333px;

 	// with the gutters of the columns being 20px
 	$gutter-width: 20px;

	// the grid padding of the whole grid on the left and right will be 20px
	$grid-padding: 20px;

	// don't worry about me
	$active-width: $base-width - (2 * $grid-padding);

	// another thing that is derived from previous values
	$inner-padding: 100 / ($active-width / $grid-padding) * 1%;
}
{% endhighlight %}

	<p>This creates a 6 column liquid grid for the breakpoint <code>$small-screen</code>.</p>
	<p>This is the ONLY place you define grids.</p>
	<p>NOTE: It is important that you calculate the values as precise as possible (ie 43px WILL look way different than 43.33333333333333333333px). Don't trust the designs, plug in the cols/gutters/grid padding and make sure it equals the defined ideal width.</p>
	<p>Huzzah!</p>

	<h3>Using the Responsive Grid</h3>

	<h4>Original</h4>
	<p>We have breakpoints from _base, and unique liquid grids for each breakpoint defined in at-breakpoint() in _mixins, how do we use these in our scss files?</p>
	<p>With the mixin span-columns() inside the at-breakpoint() mixin of course!</p>
	<h5>Example 1</h5>

{% highlight sass %}
#wrapper {
	@include at-breakpoint($small-screen) {
		#header {
			@include span-columns(3);
		}
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

	<p>At viewport <code>$small-screen</code> (0-599px defined in _base), the #header will span 3 columns, in this case 3 columns will be ~50%, cause the grid ends up being a 6 col grid (see step 3)</p>
	<h5>Example</h5>
{% highlight sass %}
#wrapper {
	@include at-breakpoint($large-screen) {
		#header {
			@include span-columns(3);
		}
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

	<p>At viewport <code>$large-screen</code> (1000px up as defined in _base) the same exact #header div will be at ~25%, 'cause that grid ends up being 12 columns as defined in _mixins.</p>
	<p>That's it!</p>
	<p>The rest of the mixins are just commented frosting on the delicious sponge cake that is CHUSY.</p>

	<h4>Flexible Gutter</h4>
	<p>In the flexible gutter version of chusy, `column width` is 100% divided by the total columns. The gutter is created by the padding on the columns. You can specify gutter width in _base.scss `$gutter-width`.  You can define total number of columns in the break point mixin:

{% highlight sass %}
//in _base.scss
$gutter-width: 30px; // it creates 15px padding left and right on a column

// in _mixins-flexible-gutter.scss
// if the first value of the variable $small-screen (it's value being: "small-screen 0 599px") is small screen...
@if nth($viewport, 1) == small-screen {

 	// defines total columns
 	$total-columns: 6;

 	// calculate each column's width
	$column-width: (100 /$total-columns) * 1%;

	// defines the margin between content and the browser border.
	$page-margin: 3%;

}
{% endhighlight %}

	<p>Define the column width with span-columns();
	<h5>Example</h5>

{% highlight sass %}
.side-content {
	// .side-content will take up 3 columns as its width: 3 * 100% / 12 = 25%
	@include span-columns(3);

	// .side-content will take up 6 columns as its width: 6 * 100% / 6 = 100%
	@include at-breakpoint($small-screen) {
		@include span-columns(6);
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}
