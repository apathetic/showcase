Version
----

0.1.0


Tech
-----------

Huge showcase makes use of a number of technologies:

* [HarpJS] - awesome static site generator


Installation
--------------

### Quick Version

```sh
$ ssh://git@stash.hugeinc.com:7999/cmpts/showcase.git
$ npm install
$ npm run server
```

Adding your own Component
--------------

It is easy, but there is some opinionation on how things need to be structured.

- First, put your fancy component into its own repo and commit it.
- Add a demo page showcasing all the whirlygigs and fizzbangers of your component (see note)
- Add your component repo here, as a submodule. To wit:

```sh
$ cd components
$ git submodule add <your_repo_url>
```

**IMPORTANT** Okay there is one opinioned bit that makes all this work. In your demo page, wrap the salient bits of the demo in ```<main>```. The ```<main>``` gets ripped out and glued into each component page herein,  so make sure your documentation, demo, includes, etc. are all with this element.

Have a look at some of the other submodules if there is any confusion, or ping me directly: whatch@hugeinc.com.


Generating Component pages
--------------
This runs automatically every time you spin up the server. There is no watch command at the moment. But, you should be working in your own component repo to have things super-amazing first anyway, before it's even added here.

However, if you absolutely want there is a command to programatically wipe and regenerate all component pages:

```sh
$ npm run builder
```


Updating the Showcase Website
--------------

Simply:

```sh
$ npm run deploy
```

The builds and pushes to showcase.hugeops.com as well as hugeinc.github.io/showcase
