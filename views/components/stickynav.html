				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>This module is actually two components in one. The first one is a
           Sticky component that enables an element to scroll along with the
           page and anchor to the top of it when it encounters the upper edge
           of the viewport.  Alternatively, the element may also be bounded by
           its parent's bottom edge as well.<p>
				<p>The second module is an auto-generating menu. The module will
           parse the DOM for <code>data-nav</code> attribues and construct
           a menu that may be used to navigate the page.</p>
